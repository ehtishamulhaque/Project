# Blockchain Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the research project on addressing the scalability and storage capacity limitations of blockchain-based IoT systems while providing secure and tamper-proof data management.


# Problem Statement
The growing adoption of blockchain technology and IoT systems has led to the need for scalable and secure data management solutions. This research aims to address the scalability and storage capacity limitations of blockchain-based IoT systems while providing secure and tamper-proof data management. We propose an architecture that leverages off-chain storage, sharding, and a lightweight consensus mechanism, such as Delegated proof of stake to improve the efficiency, security, traceability and scalability of data collected from IoT nodes.

# Proposed Architecture
Our proposed architecture consists of a blockchain-based core network that handles the management of transactions and smart contracts, and off-chain storage solutions that enable the storage of vast data generated by IoT nodes. Sharding is used to divide the network into smaller partitions, each with its own set of nodes that handle transactions for a subset of IoT devices. The consensus mechanism used is Delegated proof of stake, which enables efficient and secure validation of transactions while reducing the computational overhead.

# Usage
This repository contains the implementation of the proposed architecture in EOSIO Network along with documentation and test scripts. The code can be run on a local or jungle testnet, and the documentation provides guidance on how to configure and deploy the system. This smart contract is designed to allow multiple edge nodes to execute the IoT node action in parallel. Each edge node can independently submit its IoT data to the blockchain. The repository includes the following files and directories:
